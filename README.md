# Atropos

Atropos is an old project used as a test bed for 3d computer graphics using legacy Java OpenGL (JOGL). Code was mainly
written from 2007 till 2011. The code is not very clean and was rather hacked. Since it contains some interesting ideas
I created gradle build file, initialized a new git repository and pushed it for documentary reasons to github.
